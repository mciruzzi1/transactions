This project was run inside of Visual Studio Code that has C++ and G++ installed. Please refer to this link to learn how to install the necessary requirements to run c++ code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

HOW TO RUN:
1. Build the code within visual studio by going to Run->Run without debugging.
2. In the terminal, run the executable created with the build with the command ./transactions.

NOTE: The main function is exactly the same as it is in the assignments figures. If any functions would need to be tested individually, more code must be implemented into main. 

In order for this to become an official assignment in the future, I would improve the instructions for this assignment. As it stands, the instructions feel very random and with no order. It was very hard to follow what exactly each function should do. I would maybe recommend writing a breakdown per function to make it easier to understand, as reading the funcionality required left me a little confused. I think the figures are a nice addition to help the user know if their code is working or not. With those changes, I think this would be a good official assignment.
